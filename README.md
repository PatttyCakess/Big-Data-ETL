# Big-Data-ETL

This project consists of accessing tab-separated values (tsv) files of amazon reviews for certain categories of products. I used PySpark to retrieve the files from Amazon within Google Colab; I used files containing reviews of software and pet products. I then cleaned the and transformed the files to create various tables. I then created a RDS instance and connected it to a SQL server I created locally. I then uploaded the tables I created to the SQL servers for storage.
